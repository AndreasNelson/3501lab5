## Pairing Analysis
### Output
#### Unsatisfactory Pairings
- A with p1
- B with p1
- D with p4
#### Final Pairing
{A=p2, B=p3, C=p1, D=p5, E=p4}

## Conclusion
The pairing `{A=p2, B=p3, C=p1, D=p5, E=p4}` is satisfactory if no programmer or company can improve their situation by switching partners. Given the preferences:

- **p2 and A** are satisfied because A prefers p2 the most.
- **p3 and B** are satisfied because B prefers p3 the most.
- **p1 and C** are satisfied because C prefers p1 the most.
- **p5 and D** are not ideally matched, but D prefers p5 over p4.
- **p4 and E** are satisfied because E prefers p4 the most.

Despite some unsatisfactory pairings (e.g., p2 with A and p5 with D), the overall pairing is considered satisfactory because no one can improve their situation by switching partners.
